chose a b
PRIMES = all primes up to b
EXPONENTS = initially empty hashmap of exponent vectors
while(length of SMOOTHS < length of PRIMES + 1)
    chose x's starting at x = sqrt(n) +1
    check if x^2 (mod n) is B smooth

    if B smooth
        add to array SMOOTHS
        calculate exponent vector and add to EXPONENTS
    else
        discard
    
gaussian elimination on EXPONENTS

calculate exponent linear combination

calculate the number from the exponent vector and square root it

gcd()
